\textbf{Title}: Approximation Algorithms for stochastic Inventory
Control Models

\textbf{Team}: Hao Yuan, Feng Wei, Blake Miller.

\textbf{Project Description}:

Our project consider an \emph{periodic-review stochastic inventory
control problem}. At each period $t$ for $t=0,1\cdots,T$, we order
$Q_{t}$ amount of product, and face and random $D_{t}$ amount of
demand. Under this condition, we suffer an expected cost 
\[
c_{t}\left(q_{t}\right)+E\left[h_{t}\left(x_{t}+q_{t}-D_{t}\right)^{+}+p_{t}\left(x_{t}+q_{t}-D_{t}\right)^{-}\right]
\]
where $c_{t}\left(q_{t}\right)$ is production cost, $h_{t}\left(x_{t}+q_{t}-D_{t}\right)^{+}$
is holding cost, and $p_{t}\left(x_{t}+q_{t}-D_{t}\right)^{-}$ is
backlogging cost (i.e. cost caused by unsatisfied demand).

Let $V_{t}\left(x_{t}\right)$ be the optimal expected cost over over
periods $t=t,\cdots,T.$ We can solve our $V_{t}'s$ by solving a
dynamic programming problem:
\begin{eqnarray*}
V_{t}\left(x_{t}\right) & = & \min_{q_{t}\geq0}c_{t}\left(q_{t}\right)+E\left[h_{t}\left(x_{t}+q_{t}-D_{t}\right)^{+}+p_{t}\left(x_{t}+q_{t}-D_{t}\right)^{-}\right]\\
 &  & +E\left[V_{t+1}\left(x_{t}+q_{t}-D_{t}\right)\right]
\end{eqnarray*}


It can be showed analytically that the optimal policy is a \emph{base-stock
policy, }i.e. at each period we have a target inventory position call
it $y_{t}^{*},$ if $x_{t}\leq y_{t}^{*}$ we order $q_{t}=y_{t}^{*}-x_{t},$
otherwise we order $0.$ How every how to find $y_{t}^{*}$ computationally
is a challenging question. It can be shown that this problem is tractable
given $D_{t}$'s are independent or Markov modulated, but for general
random $D_{t}$'s, its complexity grows exponentially in the size
of the time horizon $T.$

In our project, we want to implement an approximation algorithm, which
has tractable complexity and guarantees that our approximated cost
is at most 2 times has large as optimal cost.

\textbf{Challenge}:

1. The algorithm deals with problem with randomness, and we feel it
is challenging to simulate random data.

2. Our algorithm including solving a sequence of convex optimization
problems, and we are uncertain whether there exists handy package
we can use, otherwise, implement this hand should be challenging as
well.

3. Since this is very practical model, after coding it, we would like
to apply it on real data, and do graphical demonstration, but we are
uncertain about where is find real data, and how to do this specifically.
